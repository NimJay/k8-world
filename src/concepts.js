    'sentence': `Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is a service that lets you run and manage your apps on Google's servers through Kubernetes (K8).`,
    'paragraph': `If you want your app to serve millions of users, you may need to break your app into a set of smaller apps (microservices) that can run on separate servers. These smaller apps need to be placed inside containers (similar to virtual machines) to ensure that they behave the same across different computers/servers. Thousands of these containers can be deployed and managed through the Kubernetes platform. Basically, GKE uses Kubernetes to help you upload, deploy and manage your containerized apps. Two similar services are Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Learn more about GKE <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine">here</a>.`,

    'slug': 'http',
    'title': 'HTTP',
    'sentence': 'HTTP is the language (application-level protocol) that web browsers and web servers use to communicate.',
    'paragraph': `When you open example.com, your browser sends a message to example.com's server (computer) that says, "give me your home page". Then example.com's server responds with the contents of the home page. Most of the resources that you view and submit on various websites (such as images, personal data, and form submissions) are loaded in this manner. The format of these messages (requests from the browser and responses from the server) is called "Hypertext Transfer Protocol" (HTTP). HTTP doesn't always involve a web browsers â€” HTTP is often used by computers talking to other computers.`,
